#I created a repo for the TSV loader UI (https://github.com/ndexbio/ndex-tsvloader-ui)

#I also deployed it on an Amazon spot instance to verify that it can be run remotely:  http://ec2-52-34-7-132.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com:3000

#You can try it out, but this is very much an alpha release and may not work 100%.  You can try loading the attached file.
