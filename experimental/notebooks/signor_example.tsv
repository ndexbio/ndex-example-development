Loss of Pten results in an elevated RNA level of multiple CREB transcriptional targets and increased cell proliferation, which can be reversed by a nonphosphorylatable CREB mutant or knockdown of CREB. These data reveal a mechanism for PTEN modulation of CREB-mediated gene transcription and cell growth.	SIGNOR-248543

This activates the transcription of CyclinE which complexes with Cdk2 to fully release pRb repression by further phosphorylation, establishing a positive feedback loop. E2F further promotes the transcription of S-phase genes. Thus, CyclinD/Cdk4/6 and CyclinE/Cdk2 together regulate S-phase entry via phosphorylating pRb, which controls pRb binding to E2F	SIGNOR-245483

These interactions have been considered promiscuous, but our analysis of the affinity of eight BH3 peptides for five Bcl-2-like proteins has revealed that the interactions vary over 10,000-fold in affinity, and accordingly, only certain protein pairs associate inside cells. Bim and Puma potently engaged all the prosurvival proteins comparably. Bad, however, bound tightly to Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Bcl-w but only weakly to A1 and not to Mcl-1.	SIGNOR-133756

As the level of CyclinD/Cdk4/6 complexes increases, pRb becomes phosphorylated and progression through G1 occurs. At a critical level of phosphorylation, E2F is released from pRb. This activates the transcription of CyclinE which complexes with Cdk2 to fully release pRb repression by further phosphorylation, establishing a positive feedback loop. E2F further promotes the transcription of S-phase genes. Thus, CyclinD/Cdk4/6 and CyclinE/Cdk2 together regulate S-phase entry via phosphorylating pRb, which controls pRb binding to E2F	SIGNOR-245477
